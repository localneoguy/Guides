In the latest End Update, a new money-making opportunity has emerged with the introduction of Ender Nodes or Shiny Blocks. These blocks have been updated to offer improved drops and the chance for Ender mites to spawn, dropping valuable Mite gel. This gel can be sold for 2000 coins each to NPC, or players can craft Mixed Mite gel for slightly higher returns from selling to Bazzar.
Here's a step-by-step guide to get started:

1.Preparation: Equip yourself with a pickaxe that has a Breaking Power of 4 or higher. This is essential as Ender Nodes typically spawn as obsidian, which requires a Breaking power 4 or above pickaxe to break.
2.Locating Ender Nodes: Ender Nodes spawns as End Stone or Obsidian. These blocks emit distinct purple particles, making them easy to spot amidst the obsidian and endstone walls and floors. They're commonly found scattered around the main area of the End island.
3.Breaking Ender Nodes: Once you've spotted an Ender Node, simply use your pickaxe to break it. This action will yield various drops, including the Ender Mite spawns which drops Mite gel!
4.Selling or Crafting: You have two options here. You can either sell the Mite gel directly to NPC vendors for 2000 coins each, providing a straightforward way to earn coins. Alternatively, you can craft Mixed Mite gel by combining 160 of Mite gel. While this requires more effort, it can yield slightly higher returns when sold to Bazzar.
5.Improving Efficiency: To streamline your farming process, consider using mods like Soopy, which highlight Ender Nodes, making them easier to locate and harvest efficiently.
